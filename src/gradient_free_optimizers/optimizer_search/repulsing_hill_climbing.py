class RepulsingHillClimbingOptimizer(_RepulsingHillClimbingOptimizer, Search):
    """
    A class implementing the **repulsing hill climbing optimizer** for the public API.
    Inheriting from the `Search`-class to get the `search`-method and from
    the `RepulsingHillClimbingOptimizer`-backend to get the underlying algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    search_space : dict[str, list]
        The search space to explore. A dictionary with parameter
        names as keys and a numpy array as values.
    initialize : dict[str, int]
        The method to generate initial positions. A dictionary with
        the following key literals and the corresponding value type:
        {"grid": int, "vertices": int, "random": int, "warm_start": list[dict]}
    constraints : list[callable]
        A list of constraints, where each constraint is a callable.
        The callable returns `True` or `False` dependend on the input parameters.
    random_state : None, int
        If None, create a new random state. If int, create a new random state
        seeded with the value.
    rand_rest_p : float
        The probability of a random iteration during the the search process.
    epsilon : float
        The step-size for the climbing.
    distribution : str
        The type of distribution to sample from.
    n_neighbours : int
        The number of neighbours to sample and evaluate before moving to the best
        of those neighbours.
    repulsion_factor : float
        The factor to increate epsilon when no better position is found
